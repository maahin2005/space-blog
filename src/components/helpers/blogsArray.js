      'What TF Did I Watch?: On Zola, Reesa Teesa, and Black Digital Storytelling',
    blogDesc: `If you are anything like me, you have probably spent the last couple of weeks completely engrossed in the cautionary tale of Reesa Teesa. For those who are not chronically online, Reesa Teesa is a content creator on TikTok who recently shared a multi-video narrative of her marriage and divorce.`,
    para2: `The "Who TF Did I Marry" series comprises approximately 50 parts and over five hours of content. Reesa Teesa's story also warns about the dangers of dating while feeling desperate.
    Although many people were drawn to the plot of the story, my attention was captured by the millions of individuals who gathered online to view it. In today's digital age, it is rare for people to come together around shared content unless it is a significant event like the Super Bowl or America's Got Talent. Thus, I wanted to delve deeper into what the story of Reesa Teesa reveals about the way we interact and consume content online.`,

      'You might expect Andrew Novick to be the punctual sort. After all, he’s an electrical engineer who back in 1999 created the time.gov web clock that reveals the official exact time across all US time zones. But Novick is seldom on time, and like many of us, he wishes there were more of it. “There’s definitely not enough time in the day,” he says during our conversation about today’s phenomenally accurate timekeeping contrasted with the seemingly archaic need to add leap days — and even leap seconds — to make it so.',
    para2:
      'It’s not that Novick isn’t precise. As a guy who creates and implements time measurement systems and helps keep atomic clocks calibrated for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), he just likes to squeeze a lot into his days.',

      I’m one of those annoying people who eats lots of fruits and vegetables, exercises five times a week, saves a portion of their salary, and writes or reads every morning before work — I have good self-control. What’s more, retaining this lifestyle doesn’t feel particularly difficult to me; I don’t grit my teeth to avoid unhealthy foods, the warmth of the couch, or Black Friday deals.
      
      That’s why I’ve often wondered why some people succeed at resisting temptations while others struggle.`,
    para2: `To find some answers, I decided to peek into the science of willpower. A peek turned into a deep dive, and I ended up reading over 25 academic papers over the course of two months.

      Now I want to share with you what I learned. Consider it a story about how researchers learned what good self-controllers knew all along.`,

      'To All the Women in Their 40s Who Are Saying Goodbye to Their Fertility',
    blogDesc: `have a story to tell you. I’ve never felt such a drive to tell this story before, but lately, I want to tell it again and again like a bard reciting the same words in town after town, until they are stitched into the fabric of the stars above.

      I am keenly aware of the reason behind this sense of urgency. I’m about to turn 44. This story is coming to an end.`,
    para2: `It’s a magician’s tale, you could say. The story of a being with the supernatural power to create life from her own body.

      Throw in a little romantic tragedy — a saga filled with lost loves and bad timing. And add a dash of spiritual parable — a soul-searching heroine and the lessons she learned.
      
      I listen to my friends spinning their own tales these days, as they approach 40 and beyond. The memories of their challenges as young mothers. The “just one more” pregnancies they’ve decided to pursue.
      
      My story is different. I have no memories of young motherhood because I did not become a mother. I have no plans for a last chance pregnancy, even though I realize that this is, indeed, my last chance.
      
      My story is coming to a close and I find myself less inclined to try to influence how it ends, and more inclined to simply share it so that some part of me, even if only my words, lives on.`,
